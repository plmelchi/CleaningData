```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

It was used a single R script called "run_analysis.R".

All the data was created by that single script.

A file called CodeBook.md explains both the flow of the data so as to produce the final data and the meaning of the fields.

The data set was also upload to this repository unde the name meangroupbyframe.csv.
